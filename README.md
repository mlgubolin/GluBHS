# GluBHS
GluBHS means _GluBHS is not a Basic Hydrodynamic Software_ is a software written in Rust that aims to be a GRMHD simulation software. Although we still far, far away from there, keep that in mind. This software is also GPL so that no scientist can block or restrict its use.

First, we shall make a simple hydrodynamic simulation and run it without errors. Then we can start to complicate stuff.

- [ ] simple falling gas with constant initial density simulation
- [ ] test its results
- [ ] first 0.1 release
